Welcome to my humble corner! 

My name is È˜tefan. I'm music lover, a film aficionado, an amateur road cyclist, begginer runner, occasional computer gamer and passionate about understanding how the world works. I have a particular sweet-tooth for all things tech. I've recently started getting my feet weet with computer programming. 

I am Currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, and the Django web framework. Add to that Jekyll on which I am building my
first dedicated personal web page. I've literally learned how to set up my domanin, NS, VPC and Nginx web-server on AWS this week, the 13th of 
August 2022.

This page is currently hosted on GitHub Pages and it is based on the al-folio Jekyll template. 

My short-term objective --> get from no Python in March 2022, to intermediate Python skills by March 2023
My long-term objective --> walk the road from Dummy to Master Programmer! (many thanks to Dr. Chuck, and to my dear colleague, Tavi)

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
