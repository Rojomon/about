Hi! I'm È˜tefan and I'm a music lover, a film aficionado, an amateur road cyclist, a begginer runner, an occasional computer gamer and a passionate student of 
life. I love solving problems and strive to always learn. My sweet tooth is `all things tech`! I've recently gotten my feet weet in computer programming. 

I am Currently learning `Python`, HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals, and the `Django` web framework. Add to that Jekyll on which I am building this
personal web page. This week, 8th-13th of August 2022, I've learned how to set up my domanin, NS, and my first AWS VPC with Nginx.

This page is hosted on GitHub Pages and it's a fork of the [`al-folio`](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll template. 

My current objectives are:
<ul>
  <li>Complete my personal page</li>
  <li>Get from no Python in March 2022, to intermediate Python skills by March 2023</li>
  <li>Walk the long n' twisty road from Dummy to Master Programmer</li>
</ul>

Many thanks go to [`Dr. Chuck`](http://www.dr-chuck.com) and his free online courses [`Python for Everybody`](https://www.py4e.com) and [`Django for Everybody`](https://www.dj4e.com). A special mention goes to to my dear colleague [`Tavi`](https://www.linkedin.com/in/octavian-erdei-53086223/): you are a neverending source of inspiration!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
