Welcome to my corner of the world-wide-web!

I've decided it's time to go live and present myself to the world.
At first I went with GitHub Pages for hosting, but finally opted for full-control and my own VPS.
I bet this way there's more trouble, therefore more learning oportunities.

***
These last few days I've been learning:
<ul>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>AWS</li>
    <li>Nginx</li>
    <li>How to manage my own domain</li>
</ul>
***
Please note that I'm adapting the al-folio Jekyll template to suit my needs. My About page is done, plus the social-integration.
Lots of work to be done (e.g., blog, projects, https setup), but I'll get there.

Hosting is done using an AWS EC2 instance and Nginx.
