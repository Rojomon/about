Welcome to my corner of the world-wide-web!

I've decided it's time to go live and present myself to the world.
At first I went with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting, but I finally opted for full-control and my own AWS VPS.
I bet this way there's more trouble coming my way, therefore more learning oportunities.

***
These last few days I've been learning:
<ul>
    <li>Jekyll</li>
    <li>GitHub</li>
    <li>AWS</li>
    <li>Nginx</li>
    <li>How to manage my own domain</li>
</ul>
***
Please note that I'm adapting the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template to suit my needs. My About page is ready, plus the social-integration.
Lots of work left to be done (e.g., blog, projects, https setup), but I'll get there.
